# RadioFrequency (RF)
Radio frequency Signal - Oscillation

Frequency (f) -Hertz
Number of cycle happen per second = Hertz(Hz)

## RF Spectrum

2.4Ghz
5Ghz

XmTR - Transmitter --> gives out radio f
RCVR - Receriver --> receive radio f
186K miles per second(mps)
300M mps --> speed of light

Attenuation - Obstruction affect signal

* building
* mountains
* etc

## 位 - wavelength (meters)
位 - length of each frequency

> inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency
```High frequency = low wavelength```

## RF Characteristics
* Attenuation - signal become slow as travel.
* Amplitude - height of signal  --> higher mean more power
* Phase: 
In-Phase = similar frequency --> additive signal strength
Out-Phase = different frequency --> reduces signal strength

## RF Behavior
Propagation = how signal travel accross medium
2.4GHz coverage better than 5GHz (lower f better )
* Absorption = signal loss as pass through objects
* Reflection = signal bounch off object that are larger than its 位 --> create multipath = phase

* Scattering = signal bounch off object that are smaller than its 位= like disco ball
* Refraction = direction changes when go to difference density.

* Diffraction = how data travel around the object
