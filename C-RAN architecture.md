Will be deployed on optical fibre

Access Network - Base station to phone 

Core Network - where data located

## Backhaul 
* point-to-point between access(base station) and core
* wireless, optical fibre
* transmit side
* receiver side
* transmit power & gain
* receiving power & gain

### typical question on backhaul
1) How far can it go --> varied; based on spectrum, frequency, based on product, based on  vendor
2) Can it interconnect --> yes
3) Can it connect to ring --> yes
